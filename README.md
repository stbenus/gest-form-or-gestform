# gest-form-or-gestform

*gest-form-or-gestform* is a small Python project developed as a technical test
for my application to the Gestform company.

Its aim is simple: for a user specified number of randoms, it returns either
the generated number or the number translated according to numbers which it is
divisible.

The rules defined in the test statement are:
- If the number is divisible **by 3**, the randomly generated number must be
replaced by "**Geste**";
- If it is divisible **by 5**, the number must be replaced by "**Forme**";
- **By 3 and by 5**, it must be replaced by "**Gestform**".

## Composition

The project is composed of:
- A Python package,
- A script that uses it.
- *(Soon) A Sphinx documentation.*

## Installation

### Prerequisites

As a prerequisite, you need
- [Python 3.8.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    to use the script. To check:
    ```cmd
    py --version
    ```
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    to clone the repository locally. To check, clone the repo:
    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/stbenus/gest-form-or-gestform
    ```

### Setup

If **you have `make` tool** on your computer (Unix OS or
[Windows equivalent](https://chocolatey.org/packages/make/3.81)),
you can run the following command from CLI to setup project dependencies:

```cmd
make init
```

This way will be more reliable in the long run, but if **you don't**, you can
simply type:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To obtain a number of randoms generated and translated by their divisibility (described above), you have to launch the `./bin/gf_script.py` script:

```cmd
py bin/gf_script.py
```

By default, the script returns only one translated number, this is not fun, you
can **specify a number of randoms to generate** by passing it in parameter.
Like this, for 100 randoms:

```cmd
py bin/gf_script.py 100
```

By default, the script generate integers located between -1000 and 1000, you
can specify the interval between which numbers are generated by passing a min
and max value in parameters. Like this for [-10; 10]:

```cmd
py bin/gf_script.py 100 -10 10
```

## Imaginated features

Here is a list of features that we can imagine to use the package differently,
and thus improve its application:

- *Different return formats: we can imagine allow the user specify the format
    in which the numbers are returned, for a better usability, as JSON or XML
    ...*
- *Translation rules configuration: currently, the rules are defined in a
    variable in the code but the code is developed to handle a lot of
    possibilty, this can be improved by feeding this variable through a
    configuration file...*
